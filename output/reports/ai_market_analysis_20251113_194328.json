The increase in volume trends and positive momentum scores in these sectors suggest investor confidence and a willingness to take on risk in search of growth opportunities.\n\n### Sector Rotation Pattern:\nThe current sector rotation pattern suggests an expectation of continued economic growth, with a focus on sectors that typically benefit from innovation and healthcare spending.
