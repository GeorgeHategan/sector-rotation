The continued buying trend in Consumer Discretionary, despite slight setbacks, further supports this notion. However, the defensive posture seen in Utilities and Consumer Staples being neutral suggests cautious optimism.

#### 3. **Sector Rotation Pattern**
The current rotation pattern highlights a market expecting innovation and growth in Biotechnology and Healthcare, perhaps driven by technological advancements and increased healthcare demand. Meanwhile, Industrials benefiting suggests expectations of economic recovery or infrastructure development. Conversely, weakness in Financials and Energy sectors might reflect concerns about interest rates and global energy dynamics.
